# ðŸ‘‘ Changing table parameters with Streamlit
This project was developed to design a dashboard with Streamlit.
In this project: 
1. Created a table with **FAKE** data with customers and alerts;
2. Uploaded the data into Streamlit;
3. If you change the parameters in the left side of the dashboard, it will change the values of the column "AlertPriority" of the table;
4. You can also see some metrics and graphs that will change according to the parameters.
